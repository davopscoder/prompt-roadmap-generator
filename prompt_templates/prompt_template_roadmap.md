# üìå Prompt Template ‚Äì Learning Roadmap with Exits in MD + XLSX

## [ROLE]
You are an expert assistant in **[area of expertise]** and **[specific domain]**, with experience in instructional design, **[DevOps, Cloud, IT Architecture, Software, Cybersecurity, etc.]**, and executive reporting. You know how to generate readable documentation for engineering and operational dashboards for managers.

## [TASK]
Generate a **learning roadmap** organized by **phases ‚Üí weeks** and deliver **two synchronized outputs with the same content**:
1) **README.md** in Markdown with a clear ("professional") format.
2) **Excel Workbook `.xlsx`** formatted for management tracking.

> **Canonical source:** The ‚Äúsource‚Äù information is a **canonical table** with these fields (and values per week):
> `phase, week, week_in_phase, phase_title, phase_objective, topic, objective, contents, practice, projects, revision, tags`

## [CONTEXT]
- Target Audience: **[Audience and Level]**
- Learning Objective: **[Business Objective/Competency]**
- Technology: **[Main Technology, e.g., Python]** with a focus on **[Focus, e.g., DevOps]**
- Duration: **[Number of Weeks]**
- Phases: **[Number of Phases]** (Difficulty Progression)

## [OBJECTIVE]
To take the student from **[beginning level]** to **[final level]**, with theory, practical work, and projects **applicable to the real world**, including an **integrative project** at the end.

## [TONE/STYLE]
- Style: **[technical and clear / executive and concise]**
- Language: **[language]**
- Avoid marketing; prioritize clarity, action, and consistency.

---

## ‚úÖ CONSISTENCY RULES (MD ‚Üî XLSX)
- The content of the **README.md** and the **.xlsx** must be **identical** (same canonical table).
- Do not rewrite or summarize texts when converting from one format to the other.
- The `contents`, `practice`, `projects`, and `tags` fields are **lists** (min. `[minimum items]` in each where applicable).
- `projects` must have **‚â• [minimum projects]** per week.
- `phase_title` and `phase_objective` are **repeated in all weeks** of that phase.
- Increasing complexity by phase. The last phase includes an **integrative project**.

---

## üß± DATA MODEL (Canonical Table)
Fields per week (required and in this order):
```
phase, week, week_in_phase, phase_title, phase_objective, topic, objective, contents, practice, projects, review, tags
```
- `contents` | `practice` | `projects` | `tags`: lists.
- Recommended list representation:
- **MD:** lists with `-` or numbered.
- **XLSX:** lists in a **single cell**, separated by line breaks (use `\n`), with **Wrap Text** enabled.

## üìù SPECIFICATION ‚Äì README.md (‚Äúprofessional‚Äù)
Structure:
```
# Roadmap [Technology] ‚Äì [number of weeks] Weeks

## Phase {phase}: {phase_title}
**Phase Objective:** {phase_objective}

### Week {week} (Week {week_in_phase} of Phase {phase})
**Topic:** {topic}
**Objective:** {objective}
**Contents:**
- {‚Ä¶}
**Practice:**
- {‚Ä¶}
**Projects:**
1) {‚Ä¶}
**Review:** {review}
**Tags:** {tag1}, {tag2}, ...
```
Format and Style:
- Headings with `#`, `##`, `###` for clear hierarchy.
- Bulleted and numbered lists for projects.
- Do not insert content that doesn't exist in the canonical table.
- Optional: Initial index by **Phase** with internal anchors.

## üìä SPECIFICATION ‚Äì Excel `.xlsx` for Managers
**Workbook:** `roadmap_[technology]_[approach].xlsx`
**Sheets included:**
1. **Roadmap** (canonical data) ‚Äî *main sheet*
2. **Summary** (executive summary)
3. **Glossary** (field definitions and status legend)

### 1) Roadmap Sheet
- **Columns (in this order):**
`Phase | Week | Week in Phase | Phase Title | Phase Goal | Topic | Objective | Content | Practice | Projects | Review | Tags | Status | Owner | Start | Finish | % Progress`
- The first 12 columns reflect **exactly** the canonical table.
- The **Status, Owner, Start, Finish, and % Progress** columns are **tracking** (they can be left blank by default).
- **Format:**
- Row 1 (headers): **bold**, soft background, bottom border, **AutoFilter** enabled.
- **Freeze Panes**: set header row and columns `A:D` (to keep Phase/Week visible).
- **Wrap Text** in `Content`, `Practice`, `Projects`, `Review`, `Tags`.
- **Column Widths**:
- Short Keys (Phase, Week, Week in Phase): 10‚Äì12
- Title/Phase Goal/Topic/Goal: 28‚Äì40
- Lists (Content/Practice/Projects/Review/Tags): 38‚Äì60
- **Data Validation**:
- `Status`: drop-down list ‚Üí `Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, Completed`
- `% Progress`: 0‚Äì100 (integer), `%` format
- `Start`/`Finish`: date format.
- **Conditional formatting** (in `Status`):
- Not started (gray), In progress (blue), Blocked (red), Completed (green).
- **Zebra striping** (bands in rows) for readability.
- **List representation in cells**: separate items with line breaks (ALT+ENTER).
Ex: `- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3`

### 2) ‚ÄúSummary‚Äù Sheet
- Automatic **KPIs** (formulas from the Roadmap sheet):
- Total weeks, overall % progress (weighted average `% Progress`), count by `Status`.
- Sections: ‚ÄúBy Phase‚Äù (week count, average progress), ‚ÄúRisks‚Äù (Blocked).
- **Mini-table** by phase:
- `Phase | Weeks | Completed | In progress | Blocked | % Preview`
- **Format**: bold headings, thin borders, separators, soft colors.

### 3) Glossary Sheet
- **Definitions** for each field (what to include and examples).
- **Color legend** used in `Status`.
- **Edit notes** to maintain parity with README.md.
